# Hi there, I'm Oliver ðŸ‘‹

I create open source software, mainly focused on [accessibility ready WordPress themes](https://www.webmandesign.eu/project-tag/accessibility-ready/).

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m currently learning WordPress full site editng and how to build a block theme and block plugin.
- ðŸ¤“ Iâ€™m currently working on building a block theme with the flexibility and functionality of a classic theme. A true hybrid theme for real world usage.
