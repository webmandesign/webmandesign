# Hi there, I'm Oliver 👋

I create open source software, mainly focused on [accessibility ready WordPress themes](https://www.webmandesign.eu/project-tag/accessibility-ready/).

- 🤔 I’m currently learning WordPress full site editng and how to build a block theme and block plugin.
- 🤓 I’m currently working on an epic block theme with flexibility of a classic theme. A true hybrid theme for real world usage.
